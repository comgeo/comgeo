# comgeo
This rust library contains algorithms and data structures for computational geometry problems.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/comgeo/comgeo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/comgeo/comgeo) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/comgeo/comgeo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/comgeo/comgeo?branch=master) [![Clippy Linting Result](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/comgeo/comgeo/master/fullemojibadge.svg)](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/comgeo/comgeo/master/log)

It targets both researchers and practitioners by implementing multiple
algorithms for the same problem so one can choose the one with best
performance for a particular case. Further, places where algorithms
have alternative parts, support extension, or depend on other algorithms,
the exact choices will be exposed to the library user. Sensible defaults
will allow non-experts to use the library despite the high configurability.

## Examples
A few examples lets you hit the ground running. See the
